<h2>What is <i>ktup</i>?</h2>
<p>
Both <b>FASTA</b> and <b>BLAST</b> use a rapid word-based lookup
strategy to speed the initial phase of the similarity search.  In
protein searches, <b>FASTA</b> looks for pairs of aligned identical
amino-acids, e.g.
<pre>
seq1   KDKEAYADRQELQDELRQEREARQKLEMMIKELKLQILKSSKTAKE
       . ::.    .::..::..::. ::: :.. :::. .:         
seq2   NAKEGLEKIEELEEELENERKLRQKSELQRKELESRIEELQDQLET
         ^^      ^^  ^^  ^^  ^^^     ^^^
</pre>
<p>
With <i>ktup=2</i>, <b>FASTA</b> would ignore a region like:
<pre>
seq1 LNKKLLNLKQAGEHLKPE
     .....:. ..  :.:. .
seq2 FEEEFLETREQYEKLQKD
</pre>
in the initial scanning phase.  Thus, searches with <i>ktup=1</i> can
be more sensitive than searches with <i>ktup=2</i>.  However, a more
sensitive algorithm may also raise the scores of unrelated sequences,
so that the statistical significance of an intermediate-distance match
is reduced, while the significance of a very distance match is improved.
<P>
<B>BLAST</B> also looks for initial similarities using a word-size
(<i>ktup</i>) of 3, but <B>BLAST</B> looks for conservative
substitutions as well as identities. Thus, <B>BLAST</B> with a
wordsize of 3 is often more sensitive than <B>FASTA</B> with a
<i>ktup=2</i>.
<p>
For DNA sequences, FASTA uses a <i>ktup=6</i> by default.  DNA
searches with <i>ktup=3</i> are even more sensitive, but <i>ktup=1</i>
is less sensitive (at a given statistical significance threshold) than
<i>ktup=3</i> for DNA.  <i>ktup=1</i> is appropriate when searching for
oligonucleotides (&lt; 20 nt).
