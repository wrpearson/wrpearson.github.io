The [FASTA](https://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/")
programs can be used to search protein and DNA sequence databases, and
to confirm the statistical significance of a match by comparing the
alignment score to a distribution of scores produced by shuffled
sequences.  Programs are also available to display local alignments.

The FASTA programs extend the BLAST local similarity programs by
offering rigorously optimal local and global alignments, a much wider
range of alignment scoring matrices (Pearson, 2013), and translated
alignments that allow frame-shifts, and alignments with oligo-peptides
and oligo-nucleotides.  In addition, the FASTA programs can highlight
functional residues in alignments, and provide sub-alignment scoring
to reduce alignment over-extension (Mills and
Pearson, 2013,  Gonzalez and Pearson, 2010).
