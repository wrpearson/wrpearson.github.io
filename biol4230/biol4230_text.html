<h2>Suggested Texts</h2>
<p>
This course will cover topics in bioinformatics and programming.  For
the first half of the course, the Pevzner book (<i>Bioinformatics and
Functional Genomics (2nd ed)</i> (2009) J. Pevzner, Wiley-Blackwell,
ISBN:0470085851) will supplemental background, but the course will be
skipping over the book.  Although UVa library seems to think you can
get this book online, it is not available.
<!--
An electronic version of this book is
available: <a href="http://RE5QY4SB7X.search.serialssolutions.com/?V=1.0&L=RE5QY4SB7X&S=JCs&C=TC0000353892&T=marc">EBOOK</a>, -->
The book is on 3-hour reserver in the Brown Science and
Engineering Library.
<p>
In addition, we will be introducing command line scripting with
Python.  The Haddock and Dunn book (<i>Practical Computing for
Biologists</i> (2010) S. Haddock and C. Dunn, Sinauer, ISBN:
0878933913) is an oustanding introduction to many aspects of computing
used in Biology.  This book should be available on 3-hour reserve at
the Brown Science and Engineering Library.
<p>
The second half of the course will focus on RNA-sequencing and gene
expression analysis using 'R' and Bioconductor.  These topics are not
well covered by the Pevzner book (in the 2nd edition).
<p>
Students will less experience in command line scripting may also want
to find a book with Unix commands.

<h3>Sequence Analysis</h3>
<p>
<I>BIOINFORMATICS: Sequence and Genome Analysis, D. W. Mount (2004)</i>
Cold Spring Harbor Press ISBN 0-879-69712-1 Excellent,
comprehensive text on sequence analysis, with new material on gene expression analysis.
<i>Highly recommended</i>, but not required.  (<b>on reserve, HSL</b>)
<p>
<i>Bioinformatics for Dummies, J.-M. Claverie, C. Notredame (2003)</i>
Wiley ISBN 0-764-51696-5 Comprehensive mix of practical approaches
<p>
<i>BIOINFORMATICS 2nd ed., A. D. Baxevanis and B. F. Ouellette (2001)</i>
Wiley-Interscience ISBN 0-471-38391-0 Excellent overview of
databases and sequence analysis, stronger on "How To" than
fundamentals. (<b>on reserve, HSL</b>)
<p>
<i>Biological Sequence Analysis: Probabilistic Models Of Proteins And
Nucleic Acids (1998)</i> Durbin, Richard (Ed), Eddy, R., Krogh, A.,
Mitchison, G., Durbin, R., ISBN: 0-521-629-713 - Outstanding book on
the statistical foundations of alignment and pattern finding methods,
particularly Hidden Markov Models.  Very mathematical.
<p>
<i>Algorithms on strings, trees, and sequences : computer science and
computational biology (1997) Dan Gusfield</i> - Strong computer
science orientation on algorithms.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>Phylogenetic Methods</H3>
<p>
<i>Fundamentals of Molecular Evolution 2nd ed</i> Li and Graur (2000) Sinauer
-  Evolution is a much larger discipline that we can begin to cover in
this course, but this book will be used for the evolution lectures,
and it provides an excellent general background to phylogenetic
methods and evolutionary problems in general. Recommended strongly.
(on reserve, HSL)
<p>
<i>Molecular Systematics 2nd ed.</i> Hillis, Moritz, and Mable (eds) (1996)
Sinauer - Excellent comprehensive overview of molecular
phylogenetics. See Chapt. 11, <i>Phylogenetic Inference</i> for the
a current review of methods and programs for constructing
evolutionary trees.

<h3>Introduction to Molecular Biology</h3>
<i>Recombinant DNA: Genes and Genomics: A Short Course</i> Watson, Myers, Caudy, and Witkowski
3rd Edition, (2006) W. H. Freeman ISBN 0-716-72866-4
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Recombinant-DNA-Genes-Genomics-Course/dp/0716728664/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1231424456&sr=8-1">Amazon</a> (on reserve, Brown Science and Engineering Library)
<p>

<h3>Introduction to Unix</h3>
<i>Learning the UNIX Operating System</i> O'Reilly & Associates -
Excellent quick introduction to unix.  Contains many short examples
that should be tried.
<p>
<i>Learning GNU Emacs</i> O'Reilly & Associates - To get the most out
of this course, and the Unix computers, you <b>MUST</b> learn a Unix
text editor, and emacs is a power choice. This is an excellent
introduction that covers the most common emacs commands in 100 pages.
