Biol4230 - Python homework - DUE Monday, Feb. 5, 5:00 PM
</h2>
<p>
<hr />
<p>
In addition to putting the python programs an shell scripts for this homework in <tt>biol4230/hwk3</tt>, also create a file <tt>hwk3.notes</tt> that links the names of your programs with the question and contains the output for each of the python programs.
<hr />
<ol>
<li>
Arrays of random numbers
<ol type='a'>
<li>
A write a program to generate 10 random integers between 1 and 100 (1
<= x <= 100), calculate the mean (average) as a floating point number.  Print both the random
numbers and the mean.
<pp>
<li>
write a program that calculates the average of 100 random "real" (float) numbers between 0 and 100 (0 <= x < 100)
<pp>
<li>
write a program that generates 101 random integers, stores them in an array, and calculates the median (hint, use the sort function to sort the array).
</ol>
<pp>
<li>
write a program that reads a file of Uniprot accession strings and downloads the sequences in FASTA format to "stdout" (use urllib).
<pp>
<li>
repeat some of last week's homework using Python:
<p>
<ol type='a'>
<li>
Using one of the blastp (or ssearch36) tabular output files you
generated for last week's homework, write a program that extracts the
accession and E()-value from the output file.
<li>
modify the program to extract the accessions, but only for results
with E() < 0.001 (remember that the tabular output files are ordered
by E()-value)
<li>
write a program that downloads sequences for the blastp or ssearch36
accessions with 0.1 < E() <= 2.0, and runs another blastp
search (tabular format) with the downloaded sequences, saving the
results of each search in a separate file.
