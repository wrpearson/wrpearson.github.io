Biol4230 - Python/Accession linking homework 5  - DUE Monday, Feb. 19, 5:00 PM
</h2>
<hr />
In addition to putting the python programs for this homework in <tt>biol4230/hwk5</tt>, also create a file <tt>hwk5.notes</tt> that links the names of your programs with the question and contains the output for each of the python programs.
<hr />
<a href="./accessions_hwk5_help.html">Possibly helpful suggestions</a>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>
Answer questions 2 and 5 from the <a href='hmmer_demo.html' target='hmmer_lab'>lab</a> in <tt>hwk5.notes</tt>
<li>
Write a python script that uses <tt>esearch.fcgi</tt> to do a search
at the NCBI and download all the human refseq protein accessions for
<tt>GSTM*</tt> Use the search term:
<pre>
GSTM*+AND+human[organism]+AND+srcdb_refseq[prop]
</pre>
and the strategy shown in <a
href="../lects/biol4230_9_web_resources.pdf" target='pdf'>Thursday's handout</a>, slide 33.
<ol type='a'>
<li>
Combine the <tt>esummary</tt> strategy to get protein lengths (on
slide 31 of the revised <a
href="../lects/biol4230_9_web_resources.pdf" target=pdf>Thursday
handout</a>) with the XML based <tt>esearch</tt> strategy (handout,
slide 33) to print the Accession <tt>['Caption']</tt>, length
<tt>['Length']</tt>, and description <tt>['Title']</tt> for each of the sequences found by the search.
<li>
Use regular expressions to restrict the print out to Accessions from 
proteins that contain "glutathione" in their ['Title'], and
do not contain <tt>PREDICTED</tt> in their ['Title'].
</ol>
<li>
Map each of the genuine "glutathione" containing (not "PREDICTED") Refseq accessions to Uniprot accessions at the Uniprot ID mapping site
<ol type='a'>
<li>
are all the human proteins present in Uniprot?
<li>
are the mapped proteins the same length?
<li>
are the mapped proteins the same identical sequence?
</ol>
<li>
Look up the domain content for each of the Uniprot accessions in Pfam.
<p>
For each of the human proteins that can be mapped to Uniprot and Pfam,
how many of the proteins have Pfam domains that are less than 50% of
the Pfam family model length?
</ol>
