<h2>BIOL4559 - Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics</h2>
<p>
Tues/Thurs - 9:30 &mdash; 10:45 Chemistry 262; Friday 9:00 &mdash; 9:50  Chemistry 262
<p>
<b>Instructor:</b> William R. Pearson <a href="mailto:wrp@virginia.edu">wrp@virginia.edu</a>
<hr />

<b>Prerequisite:</b><br />
A course in biochemistry, cell biology, or genetics and permission of
the instructor.  Students seeking to enroll in the course will be
asked to submit a brief summary of their biology background and
computing/programming experience (if any).
<p>
<b>Textbooks:</b><br />
Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics, 2nd Ed. (2009) J. Pevsner, Wiley ISBN: 0470085851
<br />
Practical Computing for Biologists (2010) S. Haddock and C. Dunn, Sinauer ISBN: 0878933913
<p>
<b>Overview:</b>
<br />
The Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics course will introduce the
computational, statistical, evolutionary, and genetic concepts at the
foundation of modern genome analysis, and address research problems in
gene and genome structure using popular computer programs and
biological and genome databases.  The goal of the course is to
introduce students to the computer algorithms, statistical approaches,
and biological structures and processes that interact to allow
biologists to make inferences from large genomics datasets, so that
they have a clear understanding of the foundations of computational
approaches, which will be extended to gain practical experience
addressing biological questions using genome datasets.
<p>
Students will become familiar with the Linux command-line environment
and learn simple programming/scripting skills in Python, which will
allow them to perform medium-scale analysis with biological sequence
data.  The first part of the course will focus on similarity
searching, homology, and phylogenetic reconstructions, combining
programming and algorithms with evolutionary biology and protein
structure.  This material is covered by Part I of the Pevsner textbook.
<p>
The second part of the course will focus on functional/expression
analysis at the genome level, using 'R' and Bioconductor. Strategies
for quantifying differential gene expression will be explored, leading
to micro-array expression and RNA-seq expression analysis.
Coordinately expressed gene-sets will then be used to explore methods
for biologial pathway analysis, and identification of regulatory
signals.
<p>
The course will focus on fundamental concepts in biological sequence
alignment, statistics, evolution and phylogenetics, motif finding,
gene structure and expression, and biological pathway analysis, with
emphasis on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different
analysis strategies.
<p>
Target audience: Upper level students in Biology, Chemistry, and
Computer Science. Computer science students will get help with
biological concepts, with the hope that they help other students with
the programming concepts.
