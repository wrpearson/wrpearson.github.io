<h2>Previous EBI Mol Evol handounts</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<tt>ebi_molevol_09.pdf</tt> General description of Similarity searching and statistics.  This lecture takes about 2.5 hr.  I propose to cut it by about 1/3, by removing material on alternate scoring matrices, and evalutating similarity statistics.
<p>
<li>
<tt>cs650_bioinfo1_10.pdf</tt> A shorter version of the previous lecture, which also discusses reasons for choosing a program and database.  This version is probably a little too short.  It takes 1.25 hr.
<p>
<li>
<tt>ebi_molevol_multi_09.pdf</tt> A multiple alignment lecture.  This needs to be updated to include MAFFT and PRANK, which probably means removing some of the background and BaliBase stuff.
